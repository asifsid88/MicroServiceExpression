# MicroServiceExpression
MicroService Architecture example: A service which solved simple Arithmetic Expression operation ((a+b) * (a+b)) 


What it Does?
===============
This micro-service interacts with other 2 micro-services (MicroServiceAdd and MicroServiceMultiply) inorder to solve the expression.  
The idea is to see how 2 micro-services interact with each others (process communicaton within a system)


Prerequisites
===============
[MicroServiceAdd](https://github.com/asifsid88/MicroServiceAdd)  
[MicroServiceMultiply](https://github.com/asifsid88/MicroServiceMultiply)
